        <p>Lysnandie Jacques is a multi-disciplinary Full-Stack Developer and Performance Consultant living in Houston, Texas. I attended a six month Coding Bootcamp at The Univeristy of Texas Austin, where I earned my Full-Stack Development Certificate.
            Previously, I gradutted from University of Central Florida graduating with Bachelor of Arts in Business Management and Finance.</p>
        
        <p>Over the past 5 years, I've served as a Performance Consultant, partnering up with business owners to analyze statistical performanceop0lpo
            data to create and improve business processes to ultimately improve sales and customer experience. I am passionate about life and helping people pursue their business goals.</p>
        
        <p>When I am not coding or consulting, I can be found working out at the gym and planning trips to satisfy my wanderlust. I
            also enjoy volunteering in my spare time with local shelters in the Houston Area.</p>
